# TC-Law Front End🖼

### This repo is no longer active💀

I have decided to continue working on this project in a private repo.
This repo holds the FE part of the project up to this time.
The BE for this project contains lots of deployment specific node.js code that I prefer to keep private.
It makes more sense to join the FE and BE into a single private repo, to be able to share zod validation and other stuff.
For that reason I have abandoned this repo🤷.
